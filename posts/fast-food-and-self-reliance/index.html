The convenience of fast food distracts your attention from time
spent developing important skills like cooking. Years of consuming fast food
makes you reliant on external entities for living.</p>
<p>The Dunkin&rsquo; down
your block could close down suddenly one day and you start to panic
because you don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;ll get through the day without coffee
in the morning. If only you invested some time into your future by
buying a coffee machine and learning to make your own coffee. It&rsquo;s
cheaper in the long run and certainly healthier.
You can fine tune the flavor to your liking instead of being subject
to big coffee&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
<p>Take some time to become self-reliant.
Learn skills that allow you to become independent of larger structures
that don&rsquo;t care about you, they only care about your money. There is
fulfillment in self-reliance. If there is anything to take away from this
just know that <strong>you</strong> can.</p>
