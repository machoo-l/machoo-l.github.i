Fast food makes you reliant. 
The convenience of fast food distracts your attention from time 
spent developing important skills like cooking. Years of consuming fast food 
makes you reliant on external entities for living. 

The Dunkin' down
your block could close down suddenly one day and you start to panic
because you don't know how you'll get through the day without coffee
in the morning. If only you invested some time into your future by 
buying a coffee machine and learning to make your own coffee. It's 
cheaper in the long run and certainly healthier.
You can fine tune the flavor to your liking instead of being subject
to big coffee's decisions. 

Take some time to become self-reliant.
Learn skills that allow you to become independent of larger structures
that don't care about you, they only care about your money. There is
fulfillment in self-reliance. If there is anything to take away from this
just know that **you** can.
