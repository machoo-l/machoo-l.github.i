The Dunkin&amp;rsquo; down your block could close down suddenly one day and you start to panic because you don&amp;rsquo;t know how you&amp;rsquo;ll get through the day without coffee in the morning.

      <description>Lord Jesus Christ, take all my freedom, my understanding, and my will. All that I have and cherish you have given to me. I surrender it all to be guided by your will. Your love and your grace are wealth enough for me. Give me these, Lord Jesus, and I ask for nothing more. Amen.</description>
